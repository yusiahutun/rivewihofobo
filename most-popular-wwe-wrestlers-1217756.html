Even in his forties, he could deliver an exceptional performance with any opponent and is widely regarded as the greatest worker in wrestling history.</p><h3><strong>Shawn Michaels Look</strong></h3><p>One possible reason for his relatively poor drawing power as a WWE champion could have been the perception that he was too slender to compete as a main event player. This may have led to a lack of fan confidence in his abilities as the top wrestler in the organization.</p><h3><strong>Shawn Michaels In Ring</strong></h3><p>He is known as the "Showstopper" and has an extensive history of delivering outstanding 5-star matches, too numerous to be listed. The remarkable quality of his final two matches with the Undertaker, which rival some of the greatest matches ever, are a testament to Shawn's exceptional skill and dedication to his craft, even in the latter stages of his physical prime.</p><h3><strong>Shawn Michaels Mic Skills</strong></h3><p>In the later stages of his career, HBK delivered some unforgettable promos, showcasing his inherent charm and adeptness in cutting engaging speeches. It was apparent that he possessed a natural talent for delivering compelling verbal performances.</p><h3><strong>Shawn Michaels Marketability</strong></h3><p>Vince could never successfully market Shawn as the champion, but it was only after Shawn recuperated from his back injury that he gained the admiration and respect he deserved.</p><h2><strong>9.

His penchant for cruelty, combined with his imposing stature, made him a truly intimidating presence.</p><h3><strong>“Edge” Adam Copeland In Ring</strong></h3><p>Edge is credited with revolutionising tag-team wrestling through the creation of the TLC match, but his talents extended beyond just that. He was also a skilled technician in the ring, known for putting on numerous memorable wrestling performances.</p><h3><strong>“Edge” Adam Copeland Mic Skills</strong></h3><p>When it comes to mic skills, Edge excelled as a heel, following in the footsteps of many others who have done the same.

Despite his massive success, he held the title for only a few moments and was always overshadowed by Hogan as the top contender.</p><h3><strong>Andre the Giant Look&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The sight of the Giant was truly impressive, towering at 7'4" and with a weight of 540 pounds. It was evident that his strength was formidable enough to overpower any opponent in the ring, should he choose to do so.</p><h3><strong>Andre the Giant In Ring</strong></h3><p>Andre is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers in the heavyweight division, but due to his massive size and slower speed, he was never able to deliver a match that would be considered a five-star classic.</p><h3><strong>Andre the Giant Mic Skills</strong></h3><p>Andre's preferred method of communication was through his performance in the ring, and despite his occasionally difficult-to-understand foreign accent, his intimidating presence enabled him to succeed.</p><h3><strong>Andre the Giant Marketability</strong></h3><p>Andre was a unique attraction that fans were eager to see, often dubbed as the "Eighth Wonder of the World."

Dusty Rhodes began his wrestling career in the 1960s and formed a tag team with his fellow Texan, the late Dick Murdoch, which lasted for over two decades. Together, they created chaos both inside and outside the ring. Despite being a tough brawler with limited technical moves, Rhodes managed to win his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1979 after defeating "Handsome" Harley Race. Although his first title reign was brief, he went on to capture the NWA title two more times. Currently, Rhodes runs his own small promotion called "Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling" and continues to wrestle. His son, Dustin Rhodes, also appears on Spike TV's WWE Raw (1993) as "Golddust."</p><h3><strong>Dusty Rhodes Career</strong></h3><p>Dusty Rhodes had a highly successful career spanning across several professional wrestling promotions, including NWA, WWF, WCW, and TNA, and rightfully earned his place in the Hall of Fame. He achieved numerous World Championship titles and was considered as one of Ric Flair's most formidable rivals in the ring.</p><h3><strong>Dusty Rhodes Look&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Dusty's appearance didn't give off the impression of a top-tier athlete, but rather accentuated his relatable, everyday qualities.

His heartfelt outreach to the audience and his unwavering determination to win the World Heavyweight Championship for them were truly inspiring.</p><h3><strong>Dusty Rhodes Marketability</strong></h3><p>The reason why the "American Dream" was widely loved by fans became apparent due to his stark contrast with his arch-nemesis, Ric Flair. Flair symbolised the wealthy and popular superstar, whereas Rhodes embodied the relatable, hardworking member of the middle class.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>18. Mick Foley</strong></h2><p><img alt="Mick Foley" title="Mick Foley" width=1200 height=675 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1682051421_mick-foley.jpg></p><p>Michael Francis Foley, born on June 7th, 1965, in Long Island, New York, was inspired to become a professional wrestler after watching a match between Jimmy Snuka and Don Muraco. Trained by Dominic DeNucci, Foley debuted in the late 1980s and wrestled all over the world before joining World Championship Wrestling as Cactus Jack. He later wrestled for Extreme Championship Wrestling and won the IWA King of the Death Match in Japan. Vince McMahon brought him to the World Wrestling Federation as Mankind, where he famously feuded with The Undertaker and won the WWF World Title three times. Now retired, Foley is a bestselling author of autobiographies, children's books, and a novel.</p><h3><strong>Mick Foley Career</strong></h3><p>Foley was instrumental in the emergence of hardcore wrestling and the use of gimmick matches, such as Hell in a Cell. Despite winning the WWF Championship three times as "Mankind," Foley was never able to surpass the likes of Austin, Rock, and Triple H in terms of his position within the company. Sadly, Foley's career was cut short due to injury.</p><h3><strong>Mick Foley Look&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The wrestler had three distinct alter egos, each with their own appearance and personality, but it was his portrayal of "Mankind" that gained the most traction. His dishevelled attire and unkempt appearance added to his image as an outsider, which resonated with fans and contributed to his widespread popularity.</p><h3><strong>Mick Foley In Ring</strong></h3><p>Despite not being an athlete and relying more on incorporating hazardous props into his performances, Foley compensated for his questionable physical condition with his exceptional storytelling skills inside the ring.</p><h3><strong>Mick Foley Mic Skills</strong></h3><p>Foley's abilities as a promo man are often overlooked, but a deep dive into his written works reveals the meticulous thought and effort he put into crafting his promos. What sets Foley apart is his ability to deliver his speeches with a genuine passion and believability, a testament to his intelligence and unwavering commitment to his craft.</p><h3><strong>Mick Foley Marketability</strong></h3><p>Foley was a highly beloved figure, and although he was not as marketable as other top stars of the "Attitude Era," his performances were a major draw. This was exemplified by his initial championship victory, when WCW inadvertently leaked the outcome prior to its airing, resulting in a substantial number of viewers switching channels.</p><h2><strong>19.

Mr. Perfect has an abundance of five-star matches to his credit.</p><h3><strong>Curtis Hennig Mic Skills</strong></h3><p>Hennig's impressive mic skills helped him rise to become a prominent villain in the wrestling industry during his tenure as the Intercontinental Champion. His ability to speak convincingly was highly regarded by the WWF, who even offered him a spot on the Primetime panel alongside Bobby Heenan.</p><h3><strong>Curtis Henning Marketability</strong></h3><p>Vince may have faced difficulties in promoting Perfect due to the steroid scandal, which coincided with Hennig's rise to prominence. He aimed to establish a fresh image for the wrestler at the time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>20.
