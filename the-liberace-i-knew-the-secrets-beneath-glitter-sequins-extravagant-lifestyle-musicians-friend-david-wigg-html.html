But it ultimately ended in tragedy when Scott became disillusioned with Liberace’s promiscuity.’</span></p><p><span></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/07/article-2337230-19F96778000005DC-803_634x360.jpg height=360 width=634 alt="Both Douglas and Damon believe that in these days of lavish - but carefully manipulated - superstardom as practised by people like Madonna and Lady Gaga, nobody comes close to Liberace for over-the-top performing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Both Douglas and Damon believe that in these days of lavish - but carefully manipulated - superstardom as practised by people like Madonna and Lady Gaga, nobody comes close to Liberace for over-the-top performing</p><p><span>Douglas was first approached to portray Liberace while he was acting the role of a drug tsar in the award-winning film Traffic (released in 2000) – a part which could not have been more contrasting than this one.</span></p><p><span>‘The director Steven Soderbergh’s suddenly said to me;&nbsp; “Have you ever thought about playing Liberace?” I thought he was messing with me.’</span></p><p><span>‘He had me a little paranoid for a moment and we joked about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven remembers that I then tried to take off Liberace, imitating his voice with the way he used to say “Thank you very much”,&nbsp; with a wide smile on his face.’</span></p><p><span>Then Matt came on board, as Scott, and it looked as if the film would be given the green light, but prudish studio bosses at first rejected it, saying it was ‘just too gay’. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Finally, everyone agreed the time was right, but shooting was further delayed&nbsp; when Michael Douglas, who is married to&nbsp; British actress Catherine Zeta Jones, was diagnosed with cancer of the throat in 2010. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But he remained committed to the production, and was keen to return to it soon after being given the all-clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then all the parties agreed to wait one more year, allowing Matt Damon to make the sci-film Elysium.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/07/article-2337230-14B847C2000005DC-508_634x850.jpg height=850 width=634 alt="To the end, Liberace never gave up publicly pretending to be avowedly heterosexual" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>To the end, Liberace never gave up publicly pretending to be avowedly heterosexual</p><p><span>Says Douglas, ‘I’d been fascinated by Liberace since I was&nbsp; 12 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘My dad (veteran actor Kirk Douglas) lived in Palm Springs, California and his house was near Liberace’s.</span></p><p><span>‘We were out in our car one day and pulled up at crossing next to this huge Rolls Royce convertible.&nbsp; Liberace – who everyone called Lee – was driving it, and we all said “Hi”.</span></p><p><span>‘I noticed that although it was an open-top car, his hair was not moving with the breeze.&nbsp; Later on I realised it was a wig.&nbsp; He was wearing so much gold jewellery, that his face was shimmering with the sun’s reflected light, and he looked spectacular!’</span></p><p><span>‘Then all those years later, when I knew I would be making this picture, I talked to my father and a lot of other people who knew him and discovered he was an extraordinary man, a generous host, and an amazing phenomenon.&nbsp; He was an even bigger star than Elvis Presley was in Las Vegas at that time.’</span></p><p><span>Both Douglas and Damon have more than 60 changes of costume throughout the film, each custom-made and based on the original entertainer’s elaborate wardrobe.</span></p><p><span>On stage, for one of his entrances, Liberace wore a £200,000&nbsp; real fur coat, lined with £70,000 worth of sequins and Austrian crystals, with a l6 foot train.&nbsp; It weighed 100lbs and was driven off stage in a miniature version of his Rolls Royce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coat Michael Douglas wears in the film to replicate that scene is made of fake fur, and weighs considerably less.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/07/article-2337230-14B82064000005DC-399_634x480.jpg height=480 width=634 alt="Another secret Liberace had managed to keep from his fans was that he was almost totally bald and used to wear a toupee" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Another secret Liberace had managed to keep from his fans was that he was almost totally bald and used to wear a toupee</p><p><span>Says Douglas, ‘Everyone in the world knew Liberace , and this is the first time I’ve played a character that people had actually had heard of. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘So I had a lot of trepidation, particularly because Lee was, big and broad-chested, and one of his thighs was the size of two of mine.&nbsp; So I was a little put off in terms of the physicality aspect of it.’</span></p><p><span>Liberace could play anything from the classics to pop and jazz, but Douglas is not a pianist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Steven, the director,&nbsp; and&nbsp; I originally talked about the boogie woogie number which is important in the film, and Steven felt, “Look , if we can nail that, then we don’t have to keep going back to a lot of&nbsp; musical stuff”.</span></p><p><span>‘So I asked him to please find a number where there was a film of Liberace playing it so I could watch and replicate the hand movements.&nbsp; Because I can’t really play and I’m not going to learn.’</span></p><p><span>‘We’d started off with a piano teacher.&nbsp; I knew it wouldn’t work.&nbsp; So by having it on the screen, I could watch it and I could practice, and I could get my hands and little finger movements in the right places.&nbsp; Only an expert would have known I was faking it.’</span></p><p><span>And&nbsp; what was it like for Matt, being kissed by Michael Douglas, an actor who has made love to so many gorgeous women on screen?</span></p><p><span>Matt immediately burst out&nbsp; laughing at the recollection.&nbsp; ‘It was really wonderful, ‘ he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘And in terms of being in bed with Michael Douglas, I now have things in common with Sharon Stone and Glenn Close!&nbsp;&nbsp; We can all&nbsp; trade stories!’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/07/article-2337230-1A0DFA00000005DC-453_634x421.jpg height=421 width=634 alt="Damon explained that through prosthetics his looks were changed for the face lift sequence" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Damon explained that through prosthetics his looks were changed for the face lift sequence</p><p><span>Matt was only 17 when Liberace died, but remembers seeing him on TV.&nbsp;

He made his final stage appearance at New York’s Radio City Music Hall on November 2, l986, and his last TV appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show on Christmas Day, l986. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He then retreated to his&nbsp; home in Palm Springs and – in a forgiving mood - asked Scott to visit him&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott agreed to do so and was shocked to see how ill he had become.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks later, Liberace died&nbsp; at the age of 67.</span></p><p><span>Scott couldn’t be in Cannes for the film’s premiere because at the time he was in prison in Nevada for credit card theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been struggling for years with financial problems and&nbsp; a drug addiction brought on by something called the Hollywood Diet of cocaine, amphetamines and Quaaludes, prescribed to him by a surgeon when Liberace complained Scott was putting on weight after the young man’s face lift.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/07/article-2337230-14B82026000005DC-683_634x574.jpg height=574 width=634 alt="On stage, for one of his entrances, Liberace wore a £200,000 real fur coat, lined with £70,000 worth of sequins and Austrian crystals, with a 16 foot train" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>On stage, for one of his entrances, Liberace wore a £200,000 real fur coat, lined with £70,000 worth of sequins and Austrian crystals, with a 16 foot train</p><p><span>Damon explained that through prosthetics his looks were changed for the face lift sequence, where he had to have high cheek bones and a different shaped nose and a cleft in his chin.&nbsp;&nbsp; For his earlier scenes, he had to have a younger look&nbsp; and for that he had dental clampers in his mouth, to make his cheeks look more round.</span></p><p><span>For some scenes he had to strip off, but he says this didn’t bother him.&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘My bottom is very large in the frame, but it’s out of focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did warn every guy in the studio crew.
