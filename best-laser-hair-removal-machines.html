Yes, the feeling of having freshly-shaven skin is extremely satisfying to many of us, and we might even convince ourselves the process was worth it. But, is shaving actually necessary for silky smooth skin? Luckily, the answer is a resounding “No!” thanks to at-home laser hair removal treatments. Not familiar with these magical devices? That’s okay, because we’ve done our research and chosen the best at-home laser hair removal machines on the market. Read on to learn more!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best at-home laser hair removal machine?&nbsp;</h2><ul class=number><li>Best overall at-home laser hair removal machine : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">BoSidin Permanent Hair Removal for Women & Men</a></li><li>Best overall at-home IPL hair removal machine&nbsp;: <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Beamia At-Home IPL Hair Removal</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine for dark skin : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Iluminage TOUCH Permanent Hair Reduction System</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine on Amazon : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">ICE Hair Removal for Women and Men</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine for sensitive skin&nbsp;: <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Silk’n Infinity At Home Permanent Hair Removal</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine for facial hair : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Tria Beauty Hair Removal Laser</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine for permanent results : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Remington IPL6000Q iLight Pro Plus</a></li><li>Best long-lasting at-home laser hair removal machine : <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">DEESS Permanent Hair Removal System</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine for large areas&nbsp;: <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Remington IPL6500QFB iLight Ultra Face & Body At-Home IPL Hair Removal System</a></li><li>Best at-home laser hair removal machine for small areas&nbsp;: <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Philips Lumea Advanced IPL SC1998/00 Hair Removal Device</a></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are at-home laser hair removal devices safe?</h2><p>The short answer is yes, though you’ll want to make sure your skin tone is compatible with your machine (we’ll discuss that in a bit). First, it might be helpful to talk about how these laser treatments actually work. To inhibit growth, most devices rely on IPL (Intense Pulsed Light), which starts by detecting the pigment in your hair, then “zaps” it with heat to destroy the follicle. It’s only effective when done during the hair’s growth stage, which is why multiple treatments are often necessary. Sometimes, the results are permanent, but in many cases where hair grows back, it’s often finer and less visible than it was prior to the treatment. Before purchasing an at-home laser hair removal machine, keep in mind that light hair colors, like blonde, red, gray, and white, don’t absorb light as well as dark hair.</p><p>As mentioned before, you’ll want to consider your skin tone and hair color to decide if an at-home laser hair removal machine will be safe and effective for you. These devices work best when there is an obvious contrast between skin and hair colors, so they tend to favor light skin tones with dark hair. Unfortunately, many at-home laser machines are not safe for use on dark skin tones, as there is a risk of burning, but there are some products on the market that are designed to work with all skin tones (like this <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">FDA-cleared device</a></strong> by Iluminage). As an added precaution, this <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Remington model</a></strong> has a built-in skin tone tester, and comes with a 90-day money back guarantee if you don’t think it’s a fit. If you’re concerned about the safety of using one of these machines with your skin tone, you can also opt for a professional laser treatment.</p><p>Another safety issue to keep in mind is the possibility of skin irritation, though the <a href=# rel=noopener>Mayo Clinic</a> says that this side effect typically disappears in several hours. And, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Cleveland Clinic</a>, you’ll want to avoid using the device on sensitive spots, such as tattooed areas, moles, genitals, and near your eyes. If you want to play it extra safe, consider going with an <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>FDA-approved</strong></a> at-home laser hair removal machine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which laser for hair removal is the best?</h2><p>There are many types of at-home laser hair removal machines, so the best one for you is the one that is safe to use with your skin tone and effectively targets the hair you want removed. Some devices are designed to treat smaller areas (we like this <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">popular model</a></strong> from Tria for its precision), while others provide really good coverage for your entire body, like the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Remington IPL6500QFB iLight Hair Removal System</a></strong>. There are also great affordable options, including the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Fasbruy At-Home Laser Hair Remover</a></strong> (costs less than $100!), and we love this <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">portable device</a></strong> for on-the-go grooming.</p><p>Something else to be on the lookout for are laser hair removal machines that have lots of “flashes,” so you’ll be able to zap unwanted hair away for years. This <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">one by DEESS</a></strong> impressively comes with unlimited flashes, making it a great investment. In fact, many at-home laser hair removers don’t cost more than $500, which is about what you’d pay for just one professional laser treatment!</p><p>Once you’ve narrowed it down, you’ll be able to start targeting whichever areas have unwanted hair. After just a few treatments, you might start busting out those <a href=# rel=noopener>cute shorts</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>summer sundresses</a>!</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling to shop FIRST for Women’s picks for the best at-home laser hair removal machines</strong>!</p><p>See more of our&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>best product recommendations</strong></a>.</p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.

I was able to do my entire body: hands, legs, lip, bikini, and underarm in less than 15 minutes, the only side effect was a warm feeling, with no irritation. After a few weeks the hair is very light and thinner, over time I expect this to fade. I cannot be happier with any other purchase I’ve made, I’m glad I spent the extra amount, I’ve been quoted almost a thousand dollars to have this done professionally when it was not needed.”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Beamia At-Home IPL Hair Removal</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>BEST OVERALL AT-HOME IPL HAIR REMOVAL machine&nbsp;</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/best-laser-hair-removal-machines-1.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $99.98</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Lasts 999,999 flashes</li><li>Gentle and painless</li><li>More than 1,800 5-star reviews</li></ul><p>This Amazon best-seller has more than 3,800 reviews with an average of more than 4.5 stars.
