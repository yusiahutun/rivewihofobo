For the first few weeks of the month, Taurus season will help you slow down and get grounded, but there are still plenty of surprises in store with disruptive and revolutionary Uranus leading the way.</p><p>Pluto retrograde begins on May 2, heralding in a period of subtle subterranean processing, as well as marking the end of this year’s final <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retrograde-free streak</a>. On May 7, a gorgeous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new moon in Taurus</a> will remind you that abundance is there for the taking, so long as you’re willing to step up and tap in. Plant some seeds and take advantage of this fertile cosmic energy.</p><p>Taurus energy really reigns supreme once <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/mercury-sign-meaning/ rel="noreferrer noopener">logistics planet Mercury</a> ingresses into this fixed earth sign on May 15. Embrace methodical ways of thinking and focus on making slow but steady progress toward your goals. The Taurus energy really comes to a climax on May 18, when the sun aligns with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lucky planet Jupiter</a> to form a Jupiter cazimi. This is a magical cosmic moment to think big, start something new, or take a leap of faith toward something that’s been calling your name. And as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romantic Venus</a> joins forces with insightful and unpredictable Uranus on the same day, you’ll be given an irresistible opportunity to fall in love with something—or someone—at first sight.</p><p>Speaking of new beginnings, Gemini season starts on May 20, setting our minds aflutter with curiosities and a sense of mental connection. It’s a wonderful time to catch up with friends and make the most of spring. On May 23, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>full moon in Sagittarius</a> pushes us to expand our horizons and set our sights on bigger and brighter things while a Venus-Jupiter conjunction causes sparks to fly in love and money.</p><p>However, the most momentous cosmic event of the month comes on May 25, when planetary big-shot Jupiter leaves behind Taurus <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>and enters Gemini</a>. It’s been more than 10 years since auspicious Jupiter last made its way through Gemini, and this ingress marks the start of a new cycle of opportunity and abundance for all zodiac signs. We’re collectively expanding our means of connecting with the world around us, developing exciting new ideas, and embracing a greater sense of open-mindedness. As we ride into the last astrological stretch of spring, we’re truly ushering in a brand-new era.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=your-may-2024-monthly-horoscope-for-each-zodiac-sign>Your May 2024 Monthly Horoscope for Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Read on for your full horoscope for the month of May 2024, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your sun sign</a> and/or<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> rising sign</a>:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.226205997392><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p><strong>Monthly Affirmation:</strong><br>“My honesty attracts those who genuinely appreciate me.”</p><p>Your Aries horoscope for May 2024 is packed with action, especially since your ruling planet Mars is in your sign for the whole month, giving you the motivation and energy needed to slay your goals. Taurus season is a fantastic time to get a little more pragmatic about your finances and start working toward your long-term savings goals, and the new moon on May 7 is the perfect time to jump-start that process. You can make some major money moves mid-month, as mental planet Mercury hits your resourceful second house on May 15, and the Jupiter cazimi lights up your finance goals with good luck and fortune a few days later. Abundance is yours for the taking.</p><p>Once Gemini season begins on May 20, your social life takes center stage, and you’ll be feeling ready to yap, gossip, and connect with people. This busy-bee energy has you caught up in everything happening around you, but the full moon on May 23 inspires you to look beyond the present moment and think bigger about your current trajectory. Having fun is good, but don’t lose sight of the big picture. Communication is about to get even more meaningful come May 25, as auspicious Jupiter is hitting your chatty third house, kicking off a year of big conversations and lots of new ideas. People want to hear what you have to say, Aries, and it’s time to start sharing what’s on your mind. <a href=#>Read your full 2024 yearly horoscope </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.7373478539398><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_taurus.png><p><strong>Monthly Affirmation:</strong><br>“Love and abundance flows toward me with ease.”</p><p>The sun is shining in your sign this month, so your Taurus horoscope for May 2024 has some big magic in store. Your romantic ruling planet Venus is in your sign throughout Taurus season, highlighting your natural charm and imbuing your presence with sweetness. Set a birthday intention under the Taurus new moon on May 7, as the energy is super supportive of new beginnings. Your wish is the universe’s command! Some unexpected excitement and changes of heart could rock your world mid-month, as both the sun and lover Venus connect with shock-artist Uranus in your sign. On May 15, chatty Mercury hits your sign, too, lighting up your mind with new ideas and bringing your social side to the surface.</p><p>One of the luckiest weeks of the year kicks off on May 18 with the Jupiter cazimi in your sign. Whatever opportunities have been opening up or expanding in your life can really be maximized right now. Alongside the full moon on May 23, your ruler Venus connects with Jupiter in your sign, too, bringing all sorts of luck and magic to relationships, friendships, and personal goals. These alignments are extra special given that they put a cherry on top of the past year of having auspicious Jupiter in Taurus. But on May 24, Jupiter is bidding your sign adieu and entering Gemini, at which point you’ll find that making money moves is easier than ever.
