Birmingham</p><p>Who are they?</p><p>Hardly anyone had heard of the Burger Bar Boys until the murders of innocent teenagers Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis in 2003.</p><p>Twins Charlene and Sophia Ellis, 18, and their cousins Letisha Shakespeare and Cheryl Shaw, both 17, were caught in crossfire as they left a New Year’s Day party at the Uni7 hairdressing salon in Aston.</p><p>As they stood outside, the killers, members of the Burger Bar Boys, drove by and fired a sub-machine gun, hitting both girls several times.</p><p>Charlene and only child Letisha were killed, the blameless victims of a bitter gangland feud.</p><p>Until then, the bloody turf war for the city drugs trade between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew had been relatively unknown to all but those most affected by them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19715234.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_43353><p>The gangs formed after the Handsworth riots in 1985. Two people died, more than 35 were injured and shops were looted during the unrest, blamed on racial tension, police arrests and rising unemployment.</p><p>Faced with poverty in inner-city Birmingham and the threat of the far right, young people banded together in groups which soon turned to petty crime and robbery.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the Johnson Crew, named after their Johnsons Café hang-out, controlled the drugs market and nightclub security across a huge swathe of the city.</p><p>At some point there was a fall-out between members, the cause attributed at various times to jealousy over a woman, a botched drugs deal and even a row over who won a computer game.</p><p>It led to the creation of the Burger Bar Boys, which took its name from a Soho Road fast-food joint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19697297.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_43354> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19697298.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_43355><p>The Johnson Crew were based in Aston and the Burger Bar Boys operated in neighbouring Handsworth. The two postcodes where the gangs ruled the roost, B6 and B21, were only a mile apart.</p><p>As their power grew, so did their rivalry, and by 2000 there were regular shootings over drugs.</p><p>Ashi Walker, a senior member of the Johnson Crew, was shot dead.</p><p>Then another highly-placed member, Christopher Clarke, was stabbed to death.</p><p>The case against the main suspect, Yohanne Martin, 24, a Burger Bar Boy, was dropped because witnesses were too scared to give evidence.</p><p>The Johnsons went after Martin and in August 2002, he was shot six times as he sat in a car in West Bromwich, dying instantly.</p><p>Martin’s brother, Nathan, was among the gang behind the reprisal shootings at the Uni7 salon.</p><p>While the killings of Letisha and Charlene shocked the nation, they marked a watershed in how police tackled gangs.</p><p>In the 2005 trial of the four men accused of murder, anonymous witnesses were allowed to give evidence for the first time.</p><p>Charlene’s half-brother Marcus Ellis, 24, Michael Gregory, 22, Nathan Martin, 26 and Rodrigo Simms, 20, were jailed for life at Leicester Crown Court.</p><p>But things have improved in recent years.</p><p>In 2010, Matthias “Shabba” Thompson, 33, affiliated to the Johnsons, decided to make a change.</p><p>In September 2010, he contacted a film-maker called Penny Woolcock, who he had met five years earlier when she was researching a hip-hop musical called 1 Day.</p><p>He knew she had built up trust with the Burger Bar Boys and thought she might be able to help him start a conversation between the two sides.</p><p>Through Penny, he approached Dylan Duffus, the star of 1 Day and affiliated to the Burgers.</p><p>Over a year, they began to break down mistrust between the two gangs in front of the camera.</p><p>By the end of the film they describe each other as “brothers from another mother”.</p><p>When filming ended Shabba and Dylan, along with Johnsons elder Simeon “Zimbio” Moore, set up an organisation to continue their work.</p><p>Penny’s film One Mile Away was shown on Channel 4 earlier this year.
